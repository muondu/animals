<p>Most living animal species are classified in the Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes—in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs—and the deuterostomes, to which echinoderms and chordates (including the vertebrates) belong. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian.</p>

<p>Humans make use of many other animal species for food, including meat, milk, and eggs; for materials, such as leather and wool; as pets; and as working animals for power and transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport. Animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.</p>

<p>The word "animal" comes from the Latin animalis, meaning having breath, having soul or living being.The biological definition of the word refers to all members of the kingdom Animalia,whereas in colloquial use, animal often refers to non-human animals. Sometimes the word may refer to only other vertebrates, or just mammals.</p>

<h1>Reproduction and development</h1>    
<p>Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.They produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova.These fuse to form zygotes,which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula.</p>

<h1>Characteristics</h1>    
<p>Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular,unlike bacteria, which are prokaryotic, and unlike protists, which are eukaryotic but unicellular. Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own nutrients animals are heterotrophic,feeding on organic material and digesting it internally. With very few exceptions, animals breathe oxygen and respire aerobically.</p>

<h1>Structure</h1>    
<p>All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules.In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth.Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.</p>
